# geometry-client-web

This project serves to create a user interface for demonstrating the capabilities of the geometry-api-cs. The geometry-api-cs library is created through an automated port based off of the [geometry-api-java](http://github.com/esri/geometry-api-java.git) library. This means all updates to the geometry-api-java library are pushed to the geometry-api-cs library.

This web interface relies on a RabbitMQ [geometry-worker](http://github.com/davidraleigh/geometry-worker) library. 

An additional demonstration of working with the RabbitMQ worker and the communication patters can be explored at the [geometry-client-rabbitmq](http://github.com/davidraleigh/geometry-client-rabbitmq) project.
